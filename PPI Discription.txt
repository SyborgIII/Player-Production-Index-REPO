Player Production Index, or PPI, is an algorithm that I created to be able to evaluate any football player's proformance and be able to compare them to other players, including other positions. The file is an actual varsity game where data was tracked. The algorithm itself is a regression where the expected line is the bare minimum needed to be considered successfull. Positive and negative scores are an indicator of how far above or below the minimum the player is. The algorithm takes multiple inputs and are valued at 0 and 1. The algorithm then gives different weight to each category: 1. Achievement of assignment, 2. proper use of technique, 3. Elite play make. Each sheet is contected by a plethora of functions to help calculate and create reports.
